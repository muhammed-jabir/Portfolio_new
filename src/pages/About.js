          Hi! I’m <strong>Muhammed Jabir M T</strong>, a dedicated 
          <strong> Full Stack Developer</strong> with experience in building both 
          frontend and backend applications.
          <br /><br />
          On the backend, I work with <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Django</strong>, 
          and <strong>MySQL</strong> to develop secure, scalable, and efficient 
          server-side applications.
          <br /><br />
          On the frontend, I create responsive and modern interfaces using 
          <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, 
          and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, ensuring smooth user experiences with 
          clean design.
          <br /><br />
          I love combining <strong>clean code</strong>, <strong>visual design</strong>, 
          and <strong>functionality</strong> to build applications that are both 
          visually appealing and technically strong.  
          My goal is to develop meaningful digital products that create real impact.
